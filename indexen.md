## Presentation
> At the end of my L3 LLCER English course ( University of Western Brittany), I joined the Master's degree in Translation and Interpreting offered by the University of Western Brittany in Brest. As part of the Erasmus program I took in Lithuania at [the Vytautas Magnus university](https://www.vdu.lt/en/), where I attended a course entitled "Audiovisual communication and scriptwriting", which focuses on scriptwriting in the film world. I am motivated to look for an internship in this field in order to deepen my knowledge and confirm my professional attraction to this sector.
